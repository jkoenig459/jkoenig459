# Josh Koenig

Junior Software Developer and Game Developer

I make software and games using C++ and C#.  
I like building clear systems, clean code, and projects that are both fun and useful.

Below are completed projects that show the type of work I can do.

## Projects

### Unity Project: Data-Driven Puzzle Game  
Repository: https://github.com/jkoenig459/unity-data-driven-puzzler

A small puzzle game made in Unity.  
The game reads level data from external files, so new levels can be added without changing the code.

What I built:
- player controls and interaction system
- level loading from ScriptableObjects and JSON
- save and load system for player progress
- UI for level selection and in-game objectives

Skills shown: Unity workflows, C#, data-driven design, reusable systems

### Unreal Engine Project: C++ and Blueprint Gameplay Demo  
Repository: https://github.com/jkoenig459/ue5-ability-sandbox

A third-person gameplay demo made in Unreal Engine 5.  
Core gameplay code is written in C++, while Blueprints are used for visuals and effects.

What I built:
- character movement and abilities in C++
- enemy behavior using Behavior Trees
- health, damage, and cooldown systems
- UI and effects using Blueprints

Skills shown: Unreal Engine, C++, Blueprints, gameplay programming

### C++ Procedural World Generator  
Repository: https://github.com/jkoenig459/cpp-procedural-world-gen

A standalone program that builds a 2D world map using noise-based height and biome rules.  
A new world can be generated by changing the seed value.

What I built:
- noise-based heightmap generation
- biome assignment based on height and temperature
- map rendering and camera controls using SDL2
- world export to image and data files

Skills shown: modern C++, procedural generation, memory management

### C# Desktop App: Project Tracking Tool  
Repository: https://github.com/jkoenig459/csharp-project-tracker

A desktop app for tracking personal or team projects.  
Users can create, edit, search, and organize tasks, and all data is saved locally.

What I built:
- task and project data model
- WPF interface for browsing and editing items
- save and load using SQLite
- filtering and search features

Skills shown: C#, desktop apps, data storage, UI design

### Unity Editor Tool: Level and Object Placement Utility  
Repository: https://github.com/jkoenig459/unity-level-editor-tool

A custom Unity Editor window that speeds up level and object placement.  
Designers can place, move, and remove objects on a grid and save layouts as data that the game can load.

What I built:
- custom Editor window with controls for object selection and placement
- grid-based placement system with snapping and alignment
- save and load of layouts using ScriptableObjects or JSON
- validation to check for required objects in a layout

Skills shown: Unity Editor scripting, tools programming, data workflows

## Skills

Languages: C++, C#, SQL  
Game engines: Unreal Engine, Unity  
Software: desktop applications, data storage, basic APIs  
Other: Git, CMake, testing basics, procedural systems, editor tools

## How I work

- I try to write code that is easy to read, change, and extend.  
- I break work into small tasks and finish projects fully.  
- I use Git for version control and keep a clear commit history.  
- I document how my projects work so they can be understood by others.
