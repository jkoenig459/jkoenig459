# Hi, I'm Josh Koenig 👋

**Junior Software Developer · Gameplay/Tools Programmer**

I build reliable software in C# and C++, and I love applying the same engineering discipline to games, tools, and interactive systems.

- 🎓 B.S. Game Programming & Development (in progress, SNHU — finishing 2026)
- ⚓ U.S. Navy veteran transitioning into software/game development
- 🪵 Run a small CNC/woodworking business (Arcane Impressions) — I like building both digital and physical things
- 🎮 Interested in: gameplay systems, tools programming, educational & VR experiences

## 🛠️ How I Work

- I like **small, composable systems** over giant classes
- I use Git with feature branches and clear commit messages
- I care about **readable, maintainable code** and documenting “why,” not just “what”
- I enjoy taking projects from prototype ➜ polish ➜ shipped
